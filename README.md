# hello-world

Hi!

Paasvarken here. I am beginning in programming en making my first steps in javascript. I use the p5-webeditor. My goal
is to understand javascript and eventually be able to combine it with HTML to build a webpage or something. (I am not even 
sure if that's a possibility, because I don't know shit about programming).

Well, that's about it.
